      <p id="moztext">And so, blinded by <em class="f">lust</em>, the <em>Beast</em> became a <em class="f">shell</em> of its former self. As its <em class="f">power</em> diminished, <em>Mammon's reincarnate</em> rose, and the world became corrupted with its toxic <em class="f">metals</em>. And yet, there was <em class="f">hope</em>, as a <em>Phoenix</em> was born. Guided by the <em><a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">sacred words</a></em>, the <em>Phoenix</em> rose from the ashes of what fell before it, and sought to create a <em class="f">new world</em> in its image, just as the <em>Beast</em> had done once before it.</p>
