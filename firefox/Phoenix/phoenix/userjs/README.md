# user.js

This is a directory containing user.js files for Phoenix overrides/specialized configs, such as `Extended`. If you want to use the override/specialized config in your profile, simply copy and paste the corresponding user.js file into your Firefox profile's directory. The user.js file itself does not need to be updated, as it will always pull the latest config file locally from Phoenix's installation folder.
